# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices for the self-hosted file storage and sharing application in everyday language. The goal is to ensure that anyone, regardless of technical background, understands how each part of the technology stack contributes to a reliable, secure, and user-friendly application.

## Frontend Technologies

We have chosen an advanced yet approachable setup to build the user interface. Here’s why:

*   **Next.js 14 (App Router)**

    *   Provides a performant, SEO-friendly, and easy-to-navigate client-side application.
    *   Ensures that pages load efficiently and that the overall experience feels modern and responsive.

*   **Tailwind CSS**

    *   Offers a rapid and consistent way to style the application with a utility-first approach.
    *   Helps create a clean and modern design with minimal custom CSS, making it easier to maintain and update.

*   **shadcn UI Components**

    *   Delivers professionally designed components that fit into the modern UI aesthetic inspired by platforms like Google Drive and Nextcloud.
    *   These ready-to-use building blocks speed up development and ensure consistency across the application.

*   **Feather Icons**

    *   Adds clear and modern icons to the interface, making it intuitive for users to understand navigation and controls.

Overall, our frontend setup ensures that users have a pleasant, visually appealing experience while interacting with the application, regardless of their technical proficiency.

## Backend Technologies

The backend is the engine that powers our file storage and sharing functionalities. Here’s what is used and why:

*   **Supabase**

    *   **Database Management**: Uses Supabase's robust database system to efficiently store and manage file metadata and user information.
    *   **User Authentication**: Provides secure login and role-based authentication (standard users and admins) to protect sensitive data.
    *   **Storage**: Handles file uploads, storage, and backups, ensuring files are kept safe and accessible.

*   **File Backup and Handling**

    *   The backup feature creates compressed archives (like ZIP files), making it easier to store large amounts of data efficiently.
    *   Flexibility in backup storage choices (local partition or offsite cloud storage) ensures users can protect their data as needed.

The backend seamlessly supports file uploads, sharing functionalities, and secure long-term data management, keeping performance and security in focus.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

A robust infrastructure enables the app to be reliable, scalable, and easy to deploy. Here’s our approach:

*   **Self-Hosted Deployment**

    *   The app is designed for users who want to host the application on their own servers, granting them full control.

*   **CI/CD Pipelines & Version Control**

    *   Modern development practices ensure that new updates and features can be rolled out smoothly with minimal downtime.
    *   Using tools integrated within the IDE (like Windsurf) helps automate testing and deployment, making the process efficient.

*   **Performance Strategies**

    *   Use of asynchronous processing ensures that heavy tasks such as file uploads and backups do not affect the user interface.
    *   Database indexing, caching, and load balancing are implemented to maintain responsiveness even as the number of files and users grows.

This infrastructure ensures that the app remains stable and performs well even under heavy usage or when scaling up to meet increased demand.

## Third-Party Integrations

Enhancing functionality with external services is key to making the app more powerful. We have integrated:

*   **Supabase** (as detailed in the backend section) connects all essential services from database to storage, forming the backbone of the application.

*   **GPT-4**

    *   Can be used to generate help content or assist in creating user guides. This integration provides intelligent and context-aware support, making the application more user-friendly.

*   **Flexible File Sharing Options**

    *   Allows generation of both temporary (expiring) and permanent sharing links. This gives users control over how long a file should be accessible to others.

These third-party integrations amplify the app’s capabilities and contribute to a feature-rich environment tailored to user needs.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and performance are at the heart of this project. Here’s how we tackle these critical issues:

*   **Authentication & Role Management**

    *   Secure login processes and role-based access (standard users vs. admins) protect the application from unauthorized access.

*   **Data Protection**

    *   File uploads come with both type and size validations (e.g., maximum size around 100 MB) to prevent system overloads and ensure compatibility.
    *   Backups are created as compressed archives, and users can choose local or offsite storage for added security.

*   **Performance Optimizations**

    *   Asynchronous file processing and caching strategies maintain speed and smooth interactivity.
    *   Infrastructure measures like load balancing and resource monitoring tools help the app perform consistently even as it scales.

Overall, the design and implementation focus on safeguarding user data while ensuring that the system remains responsive and efficient.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, our technology choices are driven by the needs of a self-hosted file storage and sharing solution that is secure, scalable, and easy to use:

*   **Frontend**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, shadcn UI, and Feather icons combine to deliver a modern, visually appealing, and responsive user interface.
*   **Backend & Storage**: Supabase handles everything from database and user authentication to file storage and backup management, ensuring a tightly integrated system.
*   **Infrastructure**: Emphasizes self-hosting with robust CI/CD pipelines, load balancing, and asynchronous processing for high performance and scalability.
*   **Third-Party Integrations**: Smart integrations like GPT-4 for help content and flexible file sharing links further enrich the application’s capabilities.

This comprehensive tech stack is carefully selected to ensure that the application remains secure, user-friendly, and ready to scale, providing a reliable solution for self-hosters seeking efficient file storage and sharing capabilities.

We believe that this stack not only meets the technical demands but also enhances the overall user experience by offering both advanced functionality and ease of use.
