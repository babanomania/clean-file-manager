# Self-hosted File Storage and Sharing Application - App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user first discovers the application, they are greeted with a clean and modern landing page that clearly communicates the purpose of the app and its benefits. The landing page invites users to learn more about secure file storage, easy file sharing, and automated backups. From here, users can click on a 'Get Started' or 'Sign Up' button which directs them to a sign-up page where they can register using their email address or even through social login options if available. The registration process is kept simple and secure, ensuring that a user only needs to input essential details to create an account. Once registered, users can log in with their credentials. The login page clearly displays fields for email and password, and includes an option for users who may have forgotten their password. Should a user need to recover their password, they can click on the 'Forgot Password' link and follow the intuitive instructions to reset their password through a secure email verification process. After sign-in, users are immediately provided with a sign-out button in the interface so they can easily log off when necessary.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After a successful login, users are taken to the main dashboard which serves as the central hub of the application. This dashboard displays an overview of the user's file storage including a snapshot of storage usage, recent activity, and backup status. The clean design is enhanced with modern visuals using Feather icons and shadcn UI components, ensuring that important metrics and notifications are immediately visible. The layout includes a top header with navigation options and a sidebar which allows users to easily access the File Manager, Settings, and File Sharing interfaces. This central design means users can move intuitively between creating backups, managing files, or updating account settings without any confusion.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
The journey through the application is designed to be smooth and intuitive. From the dashboard, users can navigate into the File Manager page where they see a full view of their stored files. On the File Manager page, users have the ability to upload files, organize them into folders, and rename or delete files as needed. The file upload process accepts common types such as documents, images, videos, and compressed archives, abiding by the set file size limits. A prominent feature on this page is the 'Backup Now' button, which, when clicked, triggers a one-click backup functionality. This process creates a compressed archive of all the userâ€™s files in formats like ZIP and provides options for storing the backup either on a separate partition or an external offsite service. Users looking for additional functionality can schedule automated backups, ensuring that their data is regularly backed up without manual intervention. File sharing is seamlessly integrated into the flow, where users can select any file's share option to generate either a temporary link that expires after a predefined period or a permanent link for ongoing access. For users with elevated roles, such as administrators, there is an additional transition to an admin panel where they can manage user accounts, review system logs, and adjust global settings, ensuring a secure environment for all users. Each page allows users to move back to the dashboard effortlessly, preserving a connected and logical user journey.

## Settings and Account Management
In the Settings section, users have complete control over their account details and personal preferences. This page allows users to update their personal information and change passwords. More importantly, it also provides options to configure backup settings, including the ability to set the frequency of automated backups and to choose the storage destination for backup archives based on their storage capacities or security needs. Adjustments made in the Settings page are saved immediately and users receive clear on-screen feedback to confirm their changes. Once users have updated their details or configured their backup settings, easy navigation options ensure they can return to the main dashboard or move to the File Manager page seamlessly.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
Throughout the application, care has been taken to gracefully handle errors and exceptions. If a user enters invalid data, such as an incorrectly formatted email address during sign-up or an oversized file during upload, the application promptly displays clear and user-friendly error messages to guide them in correcting the mistake. In situations where connectivity is lost or a file fails to upload, the system is designed to provide fallback notifications and suggestions for retrying the operation. If users try to access content without proper authorization or attempt restricted actions, they are taken to an error page explaining the issue and guiding them back to the appropriate section of the app. These error states ensure that users always have a clear path back to a normal flow even when something unexpected occurs.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The entire journey in this self-hosted file storage and sharing application is designed to be straightforward and intuitive. From discovering the application on a welcoming landing page, to signing up with simple and secure steps, each phase is crafted to ensure a smooth transition to the main dashboard where critical information is readily available. Users can efficiently manage their files and take advantage of innovative features such as one-click backups and customizable file sharing options. Whether a user is a standard user looking to safely store sensitive files or an administrator managing a multi-user environment, every page and feature is interconnected with clear navigation paths and user feedback. This creates an overall experience that is both reliable and easy to use, reinforcing trust and encouraging ongoing engagement with the platform.
